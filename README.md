# Automove
## About Automove:
Automove is a very simple python programm that moves your mouse. You can use it for what ever you want ;)
Automove moves your mouse for about 30 min. After the 30 min you need to start the programm again.
There is also an .exe of Automove but due to coporate issues i wont post it here.
## How to use Automove:
Install these libraries first:
```bash
pip install tkinter
```
```bash
pip install pyautogui
```
```bash
pip install keyboard
```
After you installed all the libraries you can clone the code and start the script.
Have fun! :D
